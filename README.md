# `aubreypwd/autoload`

Just an empty Composer package that autoloads a file where you can do things.

# Usage

```bash
composer create-project aubreypwd/autoload something --stability=dev
```

This will create a package with this as a base. Edit `src/autoload.php` (which is autoloaded) to write your PHP scripts.
